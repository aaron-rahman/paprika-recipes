# Paprika: Easily read and modify your `paprikarecipes` exported archives.

[Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) is a lovely recipe app that works so much better than I was expecting it to, and although its recipe imports are usually fantastic, sometimes things are imported incorrectly and require manual touch-up.  This is a library I built to make that just a little easier to do.
